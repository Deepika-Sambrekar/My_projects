Key Features:
- Dataset Analysis: Comprehensive exploration of customer data, focusing on metrics such as account balances, purchase habits, cash advances, payment patterns, and 
  frequency of credit card usage.
- K-Means Clustering: Application of the K-means algorithm to group customers based on shared characteristics, with the elbow method utilized to identify the ideal 
  number of clusters.
- Visualization: Intuitive visual representations of customer clusters, providing actionable insights to support marketing strategies.
- Machine Learning Techniques: Integration of advanced dimensionality reduction methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, to 
  efficiently process high-dimensional data.
