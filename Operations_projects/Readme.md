Overview:
This project focuses on leveraging deep learning to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in hospital settings. 
A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to classify chest X-ray images into four categories: Healthy, COVID-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia.

Key Features:
- Designed and trained a CNN model for fast and accurate classification with inference time under 1 minute.
- Utilized metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure clinical reliability.
- Aimed to reduce diagnostic time and cost while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.

Technologies Used:
- Python: TensorFlow/Keras for model development and evaluation.
- SQL: Data storage and management for efficient processing.
